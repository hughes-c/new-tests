GPGPU-Sim version 3.2.2 (build gpgpu-sim_git-commit-5d3f3aa78130a30a8adcf9942261310880067169-modified_0.0) configured with GPUWattch.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INFO - If you only care about PTX execution, ignore this message. GPGPU-Sim supports PTX execution in modern CUDA.
If you want to run PTXPLUS (sm_1x SASS) with a modern card configuration, the apps and simulator must be compiled with CUDA 4.2.
You can still run a PASCAL configuration when compiling with 4.2 by setting the $PTXAS_CUDA_INSTALL_PATH directory environment variable.
The following text describes why:
If you are using PTXPLUS, only sm_1x is supported and it requires that the app and simulator binaries are compiled in CUDA 4.2 or less.
The simulator requires it since CUDA headers desribe struct sizes in the exec which change from gen to gen.
The apps require 4.2 because new versions of CUDA tools have dropped parsing support for generating sm_1x
When running using modern config (i.e. pascal) and PTXPLUS with CUDA 4.2, the $PTXAS_CUDA_INSTALL_PATH env variable is required to get proper register usage
(and hence occupancy) using a version of CUDA that knows the register usage on the real card.
